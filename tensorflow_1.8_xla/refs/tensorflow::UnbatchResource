//
// UnbatchResource keeps two data structures indexed by batch-key: one which has
// the continuations for all concurrent kernels which are waiting for tensors
// and another which has tensors which are waiting for their corresponding
// kernels to run. Whenever a kernel runs, we either grab its tensor if it&apos;s
// waiting already, or we insert it in the queue and then look at its tensor to
// see if it can be used to dispatch any stored continuations.</doc>
