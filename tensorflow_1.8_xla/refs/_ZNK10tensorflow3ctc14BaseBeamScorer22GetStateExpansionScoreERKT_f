<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/util/ctc/ctc_beam_scorer.h' l='51'>// GetStateExpansionScore should be an inexpensive method to retrieve the
  // (cached) expansion score computed within ExpandState. The score is
  // multiplied (log-addition) with the input score at the current step from
  // the network.
  //
  // The score returned should be a log-probability. In the simplest case, as
  // there&apos;s no state expansion logic, the expansion score is zero.</doc>
