// dimensions. This is usually used to make sure that the spatial dimensions do
// not shrink when we progress with convolutions. Two types of padding are
// supported:
//   VALID: No padding is carried out.
//   SAME: The pad value is computed so that the output will have the same
//         dimensions as the input.
// The padded area is zero-filled.</doc>
