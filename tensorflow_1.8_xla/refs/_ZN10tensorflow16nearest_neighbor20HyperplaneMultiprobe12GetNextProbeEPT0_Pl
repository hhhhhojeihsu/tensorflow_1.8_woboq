  // whether this succeeded (true) or the current probing sequence is exhausted
  // (false). Here, we say a probing sequence is exhausted if one of the
  // following two conditions occurs:
  // - We have used a non-negative value for num_probes in setup_probing, and
  //   we have produced this many number of probes in the current sequence.
  // - We have used a negative value for num_probes in setup_probing, and we
  //   have produced all possible probes in the probing sequence.</doc>
