  ///
  /// Most users will want to set flags to SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE |
  /// SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE. There are many other open flags; here are
  /// notes on a few of them:
  ///
  /// - SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY: Allowed if no WAL journal is active.
  /// - SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE: Will be ignored because this veneer
  ///   doesn&apos;t support the unlock notify API.
  /// - SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX: Means access to this connection MUST be
  ///   serialized by the caller in accordance with the same contracts
  ///   implemented by this API.
  ///
  /// This function sets PRAGMA values from TF_SQLITE_* environment
  /// variables. See sqlite.cc to learn more.</doc>
