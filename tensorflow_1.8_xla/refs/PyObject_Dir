<doc f='include/python3.5m/object.h' l='574'>/* PyObject_Dir(obj) acts like Python builtins.dir(obj), returning a
   list of strings.  PyObject_Dir(NULL) is like builtins.dir(),
   returning the names of the current locals.  In this case, if there are
   no current locals, NULL is returned, and PyErr_Occurred() is false.
