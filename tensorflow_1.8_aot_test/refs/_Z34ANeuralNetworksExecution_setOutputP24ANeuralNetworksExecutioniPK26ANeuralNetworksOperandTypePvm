 * Associate a user buffer with an output of the model of the
 * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The provided buffer must outlive the execution.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded usage.
 *
 * @param execution The execution to be modified.
 * @param index The index of the output argument we are setting. It is
 *              an index into the lists passed to
 *              {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs}. It is not
 *              the index associated with {@link
 * ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperand}.
 * @param type The type of the operand. This can be used to specify the
 *             dimensions that were set to 0 when the operand was added to the
 *             model. All other values must be the same as specified in the
 *             model. If the type is the same as specified when the model
 *             was built, NULL can be passed.
 * @param buffer The buffer where the data is to be written.
 * @param length The length in bytes of the buffer.
 *
 * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful, ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA if
 * the name is not recognized or the buffer is too small for the output.
