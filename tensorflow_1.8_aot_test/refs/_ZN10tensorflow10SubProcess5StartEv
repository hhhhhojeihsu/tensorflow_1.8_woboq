<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/posix/subprocess.h' l='63'>// Start()
  //    Run the command that was previously set up with SetProgram().
  //    The following are fatal programming errors:
  //       * Attempting to start when a process is already running.
  //       * Attempting to start without first setting the command.
  //    Note, however, that Start() does not try to validate that the binary
  //    does anything reasonable (e.g. exists or can execute); as such, you can
  //    specify a non-existent binary and Start() will still return true.  You
  //    will get a failure from the process, but only after Start() returns.
  //
  //    Return true normally, or false if the program couldn&apos;t be started
  //    because of some error.
