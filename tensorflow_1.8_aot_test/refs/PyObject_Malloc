<doc f='include/python3.5m/objimpl.h' l='74'>/* Functions to call the same malloc/realloc/free as used by Python&apos;s
   object allocator.  If WITH_PYMALLOC is enabled, these may differ from
   the platform malloc/realloc/free.  The Python object allocator is
   designed for fast, cache-conscious allocation of many &quot;small&quot; objects,
   and with low hidden memory overhead.

   PyObject_Malloc(0) returns a unique non-NULL pointer if possible.

   PyObject_Realloc(NULL, n) acts like PyObject_Malloc(n).
   PyObject_Realloc(p != NULL, 0) does not return  NULL, or free the memory
   at p.

   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly; no action is
   performed on failure other than to return NULL (no warning it printed, no
   exception is set, etc).

   For allocating objects, use PyObject_{New, NewVar} instead whenever
   possible.  The PyObject_{Malloc, Realloc, Free} family is exposed
   so that you can exploit Python&apos;s small-block allocator for non-object
   uses.  If you must use these routines to allocate object memory, make sure
   the object gets initialized via PyObject_{Init, InitVar} after obtaining
   the raw memory.
