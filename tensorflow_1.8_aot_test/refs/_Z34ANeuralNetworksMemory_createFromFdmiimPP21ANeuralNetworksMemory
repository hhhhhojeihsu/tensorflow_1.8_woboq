 * Creates a shared memory object from a file descriptor.
 *
 * The shared memory is backed by a file descriptor via mmap.
 * See {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory} for a description on how to use
 * this shared memory.
 *
 * @param size The requested size in bytes.
 *             Must not be larger than the file size.
 * @param prot The desired memory protection for the mapping.
 *             It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or
 *             more of the following flags: PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE.
 * @param fd The requested file descriptor.
 *           The file descriptor has to be mmap-able. The file
 *           descriptor will be duplicated.
 * @param offset The offset to the beginning of the file of the area to map.
 *               The offset has to be aligned to a page size.
 * @param memory The memory object to be created.
 *               Set to NULL if unsuccessful.
 *
 * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if the request completed normally.
