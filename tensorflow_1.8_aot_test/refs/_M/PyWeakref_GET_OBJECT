<doc f='include/python3.5m/weakrefobject.h' l='70'>/* Explanation for the Py_REFCNT() check: when a weakref&apos;s target is part
   of a long chain of deallocations which triggers the trashcan mechanism,
   clearing the weakrefs can be delayed long after the target&apos;s refcount
   has dropped to zero.  In the meantime, code accessing the weakref will
   be able to &quot;see&quot; the target object even though it is supposed to be
   unreachable.  See issue #16602. */</doc>
