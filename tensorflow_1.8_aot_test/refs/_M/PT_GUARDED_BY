<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/default/thread_annotations.h' l='55'>// Document if the memory location pointed to by a pointer should be guarded
// by a mutex when dereferencing the pointer.  PT_GUARDED_VAR is analogous to
// GUARDED_VAR.   Note that a pointer variable to a shared memory location
// could itself be a shared variable. For example, if a shared global pointer
// q, which is guarded by mu1, points to a shared memory location that is
// guarded by mu2, q should be annotated as follows:
//     int *q GUARDED_BY(mu1) PT_GUARDED_BY(mu2);</doc>
