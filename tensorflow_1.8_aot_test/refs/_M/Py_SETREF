 *
 * As in case of Py_CLEAR &quot;the obvious&quot; code can be deadly:
 *
 *     Py_DECREF(op);
 *     op = op2;
 *
 * The safe way is:
 *
 *      Py_SETREF(op, op2);
 *
 * That arranges to set `op` to `op2` _before_ decref&apos;ing, so that any code
 * triggered as a side-effect of `op` getting torn down no longer believes
 * `op` points to a valid object.
 *
 * Py_XSETREF is a variant of Py_SETREF that uses Py_XDECREF instead of
 * Py_DECREF.
