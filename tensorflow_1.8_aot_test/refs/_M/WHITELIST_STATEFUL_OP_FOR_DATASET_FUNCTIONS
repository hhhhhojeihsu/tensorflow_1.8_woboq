<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/dataset_stateful_op_whitelist.h' l='52'>// Use this macro to whitelist an op that is marked stateful but needs to be
// used inside a map_fn in an input pipeline. This is only needed if you wish
// to be able to checkpoint the state of the input pipeline. We currently
// do not allow stateful ops to be defined inside of map_fns since it is not
// possible to save their state.
// Note that the state of the whitelisted ops inside functions will not be
// saved during checkpointing, hence this should only be used if the op is
// marked stateful for reasons like to avoid constant folding during graph
// optimiztion but is not stateful.
// If possible, try to remove the stateful flag on the op first.
// Example usage:
//
//   WHITELIST_STATEFUL_OP_FOR_DATASET_FUNCTIONS(&quot;LegacyStatefulReader&quot;);
