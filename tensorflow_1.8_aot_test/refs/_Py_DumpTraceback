<doc f='include/python3.5m/traceback.h' l='34'>/* Write the Python traceback into the file &apos;fd&apos;. For example:

       Traceback (most recent call first):
         File &quot;xxx&quot;, line xxx in &lt;xxx&gt;
         File &quot;xxx&quot;, line xxx in &lt;xxx&gt;
         ...
         File &quot;xxx&quot;, line xxx in &lt;xxx&gt;

   This function is written for debug purpose only, to dump the traceback in
   the worst case: after a segmentation fault, at fatal error, etc. That&apos;s why,
   it is very limited. Strings are truncated to 100 characters and encoded to
   ASCII with backslashreplace. It doesn&apos;t write the source code, only the
   function name, filename and line number of each frame. Write only the first
   100 frames: if the traceback is truncated, write the line &quot; ...&quot;.

   This function is signal safe. */</doc>
