   * Looks up items from a given tensor.
   *
   * Each item in the output is a raw copy of the corresponding item in
   * the input “values”. If the given “lookup” indices are out of bounds,
   * the op will fail and an error will be reported.
   *
   * Inputs:
   * * 0: Values. An n-D tensor of any type X (where n &gt;= 2). E.g., if n is 2,
   *      then the shape would be [lookup_dimension, values_dimension], where
   *      “lookup_dimension” corresponds to the indexing dimension in the lookup
   *      table, and “values_dimension” to the contents.
   * * 1: Lookups. An 1-D tensor of type T, of shape [lookup_size], where
   *      “lookup_size” is the number of elements to look for, and each entry
   *      corresponds to the first dimension of the “values” tensor.
   *
   * Output:
   * * 0: A n-D tensor of type X and the same rank and shape as the “values”
   *      tensor, except for the first dimension which has size “lookup_size”.
