       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from an %unordered_set.  Note that this function only erases the
       *  element, and that if the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to
       *  memory is not touched in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s
       *  responsibility.
