   The clock is not affected by system clock updates. The reference point of
   the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the
   results of consecutive calls is valid.

   Fill info (if set) with information of the function used to get the time.

   Return 0 on success, raise an exception and return -1 on error. */</doc>
