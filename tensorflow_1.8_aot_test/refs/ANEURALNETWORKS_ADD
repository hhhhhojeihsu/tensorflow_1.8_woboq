   *
   * Takes two input tensors of identical type and compatible dimensions. The
   * output is the sum of both input tensors, optionally modified by an
   * activation function.
   *
   * Two dimensions are compatible when:
   *     1. they are equal, or
   *     2. one of them is 1
   *
   * The size of the output is the maximum size along each dimension of the
   * input operands. It starts with the trailing dimensions, and works its way
   * forward.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     input1.dimension = {4, 1, 2}
   *     input2.dimension = {5, 4, 3, 1}
   *     output.dimension = {5, 4, 3, 2}
   *
   * Supported tensor types:
   * * {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32}
   *
   * Supported tensor rank: up to 4
   *
   * Inputs:
   * * 0: A tensor.
   * * 1: A tensor of the same type, and compatible dimensions as input0.
   * * 2: An INT32 value, and has to be one of the {@link FuseCode} values.
   *      Specifies the activation to invoke on the result of each addition.
   *
   * Outputs:
   * * 0: The sum, a tensor of the same type as input0.
