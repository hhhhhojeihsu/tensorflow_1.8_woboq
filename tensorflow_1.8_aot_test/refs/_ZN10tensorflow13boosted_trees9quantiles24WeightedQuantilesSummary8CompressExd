<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/boosted_trees/lib/quantiles/weighted_quantiles_summary.h' l='187'>// Compresses buffer into desired size. The size specification is
  // considered a hint as we always keep the first and last elements and
  // maintain strict approximation error bounds.
  // The approximation error delta is taken as the max of either the requested
  // min error or 1 / size_hint.
  // After compression, the approximation error is guaranteed to increase
  // by no more than that error delta.
  // This algorithm is linear in the original size of the summary and is
  // designed to be cache-friendly.</doc>
