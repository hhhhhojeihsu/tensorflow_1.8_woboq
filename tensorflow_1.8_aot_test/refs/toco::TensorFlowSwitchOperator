//
// Inputs:
//   inputs[0]: required: the input array
//   inputs[1]: required: the boolean predicate, given as an array of size 1
//     and of type kBool, will determine which output gets selected.
//
// Outputs: a TensorFlow Switch node always has exactly two outputs. Depending
// on the boolean value that the input predicate resolves to (see note below),
// one or the other of the outputs will be &apos;selected&apos;: the input array will be
// forwarded to the &apos;selected output&apos; as if by a Identity node, while the other
// output will be discarded, and any graph edge connecting that discarded output
// will be dropped. The rule for selecting outputs is as follows:
//   outputs[0] will be selected if the input predicate resolves to &apos;true&apos;.
//   outputs[1] will be selected if the input predicate resolves to &apos;false&apos;.
//
// Note: We do not currently support runtime control flow: we only support
// control flow that can be resolved at tooling time (independently of input
// activations).</doc>
