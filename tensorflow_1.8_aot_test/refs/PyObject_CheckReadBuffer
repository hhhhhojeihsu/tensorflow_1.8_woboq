      Takes an arbitrary object which must support the (character,
      single segment) buffer interface and returns a pointer to a
      read-only memory location useable as character based input
      for subsequent processing.

      0 is returned on success.  buffer and buffer_len are only
      set in case no error occurs. Otherwise, -1 is returned and
      an exception set.
