 * Schedule evaluation of the execution.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Schedules evaluation of the execution. Once the model has been
 * applied and the outputs are ready to be consumed, the execution will be
 * signaled. Use {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait} to wait for that signal.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * Multiple executions can be scheduled and evaluated concurrently, and
 * compilations can be performed concurrently with executions. The runtime makes
 * no guarantee on the ordering of the completion of compilations and
 * executions. If it&apos;s important to the application, the application should
 * enforce the ordering by using {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_wait} and
 * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait}.
 *
 * ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait must be called to recuperate the resources used
 * by the execution.
 *
 * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded usage.
 *
 * @param execution The execution to be scheduled and executed.
 *
 * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
