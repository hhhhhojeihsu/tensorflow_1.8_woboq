 * Sets an operand to a value stored in a memory object.
 *
 * The content of the memory is not copied. A reference to that memory is stored
 * inside the model. The application is responsible for not changing the content
 * of the memory region until all executions using this model have completed.
 * As the data may be copied during processing, modifying the data after this
 * call yields undefined results.
 *
 * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
 * been called will return an error.
 *
 * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
 *
 * @param model The model to be modified.
 * @param index The index of the model operand we&apos;re setting.
 * @param buffer A pointer to the data to use.
 * @param memory The memory containing the data.
 * @param offset This specifies the location of the data within the memory.
 *               The offset is in bytes from the start of memory.
 * @param length The size in bytes of the data value.
 *
 * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
