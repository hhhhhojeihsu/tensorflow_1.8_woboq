   * Attempts to add a gradient to the accumulator. An ApplyGrad attempt is
   * successful (i.e., has its gradient applied) if its local_step &gt;=
   * current_global_step_ at the time the attempt is processed. Otherwise, if
   * local_step &lt; current_global_step_, the stale gradient is silently dropped.
   *
   * local_step: Time-step at which the gradient was computed.
   * grad:       Gradient tensor to be added to the accumulator.
   * ctx:        Context in which the op is executed.
