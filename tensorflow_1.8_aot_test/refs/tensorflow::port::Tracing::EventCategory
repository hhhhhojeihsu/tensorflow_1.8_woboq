<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/tracing.h' l='38'>// This enumeration contains the identifiers of all TensorFlow
  // threadscape events and code regions.  Threadscape assigns its
  // own identifiers at runtime when we register our events and we
  // cannot know in advance what IDs it will choose.  The &quot;RecordEvent&quot;
  // method and &quot;ScopedActivity&quot; use these event IDs for consistency
  // and remap them to threadscape IDs at runtime.  This enum is limited
  // to 64 values since we use a bitmask to configure which events are
  // enabled.  It must also be kept in step with the code in
  // &quot;Tracing::EventCategoryString&quot;.</doc>
