      Same as PyObject_AsCharBuffer() except that this API expects
      (readable, single segment) buffer interface and returns a
      pointer to a read-only memory location which can contain
      arbitrary data.

      0 is returned on success.  buffer and buffer_len are only
      set in case no error occurs.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and
      an exception set.
