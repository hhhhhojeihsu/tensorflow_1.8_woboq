   * Projects an input to a bit vector via locality sensitive hashing.
   *
   * Inputs:
   * * 0: Hash functions. Dim.size == 2, DataType: Float.
   *            Tensor[0].Dim[0]: Number of hash functions.
   *            Tensor[0].Dim[1]: Number of seeds per hash functions.
   *            Tensor[0].Dim[1] &lt;= 32 in sparse case.
   *
   * * 1: Input. Dim.size &gt;= 1, no restriction on DataType.
   * * 2: Weight. Optional. Dim.size == 1, DataType: Float.
   *     If not set, each input element is considered to have the same weight of
   *     1.0.
   *     Tensor[1].Dim[0] == Tensor[2].Dim[0]
   * * 3: Type:
   *        Sparse: Value LSHProjectionType_SPARSE(=1).
   *          Computed bit vector is considered to be sparse.
   *          Each output element is an int32 made up of multiple bits computed
   * from hash functions.
   *
   *        Dense: Value LSHProjectionType_DENSE(=2).
   *          Computed bit vector is considered to be dense. Each output element
   *          represents a bit and can take the value of either 0 or 1.
   *
   * Outputs:
   * * 0: If the projection type is sparse:
   *        Output.Dim == { Tensor[0].Dim[0] }
   *        A tensor of int32 that represents hash signatures.
   *      If the projection type is Dense:
   *        Output.Dim == { Tensor[0].Dim[0] * Tensor[0].Dim[1] }
   *        A flattened tensor that represents projected bit vectors.
