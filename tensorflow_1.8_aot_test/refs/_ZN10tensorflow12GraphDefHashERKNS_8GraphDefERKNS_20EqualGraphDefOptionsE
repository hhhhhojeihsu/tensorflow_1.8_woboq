<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/util/equal_graph_def.h' l='42'>// Returns a hash of `gdef` that is consistent with EqualGraphDef. In other
// words, if two graph defs compare equal according to EqualGraphDef,
// GraphDefHash will return the same value for both of them when called
// with the same `options` that was used in the call to EqualGraphDef.
// Similarly to protobuf deterministic serialization, hash value is
// guaranteed to be stable only for a given binary. In particular, one should
// probably not persist the returned value.</doc>
