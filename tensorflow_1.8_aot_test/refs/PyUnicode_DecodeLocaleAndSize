   *surrogateescape* is equal to zero, otherwise it uses the &apos;surrogateescape&apos;
   error handler (PEP 383) to escape undecodable bytes. If a byte sequence can
   be decoded as a surrogate character and *surrogateescape* is not equal to
   zero, the byte sequence is escaped using the &apos;surrogateescape&apos; error handler
   instead of being decoded. *str* must end with a null character but cannot
   contain embedded null characters. */</doc>
