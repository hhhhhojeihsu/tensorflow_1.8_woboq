<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/c/python_api.h' l='46'>// Extends `session` with any new operations added to its associated graph.
// Usually this happens automatically in TF_SessionRun. After this is called,
// TF_SessionRun will no longer extend the session on every call.
//
// We expose this here to allow fine-grained synchronization in multi-threaded
// workloads, which is required since the Python implementation depends on the
// above mutation methods. This allows us to prevent modifications to nodes in
// the graph after the session has been made aware of them.</doc>
