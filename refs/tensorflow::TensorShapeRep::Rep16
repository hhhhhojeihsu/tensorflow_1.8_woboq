<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.h' l='83'>// We use 16 bytes to represent a TensorShape.  Because we need to
  // be able to support full 64-bit dimension sizes and an arbitrary
  // number of dimensions for a Tensor, but most tensor dimensions are
  // significantly smaller than 64 bits and most tensors are 1, 2, or 3
  // dimensions, we have several representations.
  // Rep16: Supports up to 6 dimensions where each dimension is &lt; 2^16 - 1
  // Rep32: Supports up to 3 dimensions where each dimension is &lt; 2^32 - 1
  // Rep64: Supports arbitrary dimensionality, 64-bit dimensions using
  //        an out of line vector.
  // For PartialTensorShape, a dimension of static_cast&lt;uint??&gt;(-1) is unknown.
  // This value is not allowed in TensorShape either for format compatibility.</doc>
