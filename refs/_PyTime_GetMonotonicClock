<doc f='include/python3.5m/pytime.h' l='145'>/* Get the time of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock that cannot go backwards.
   The clock is not affected by system clock updates. The reference point of
   the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the
   results of consecutive calls is valid.

   The function cannot fail. _PyTime_Init() ensures that a monotonic clock
   is available and works. */</doc>
