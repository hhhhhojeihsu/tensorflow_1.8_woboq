///
/// The file is an append-only records file of tf.Event protos. That
/// makes this summary writer suitable for file systems like GCS.
///
/// It will enqueue up to max_queue summaries, and flush at least every
/// flush_millis milliseconds. The summaries will be written to the
/// directory specified by logdir and with the filename suffixed by
/// filename_suffix. The caller owns a reference to result if the
/// returned status is ok. The Env object must not be destroyed until
/// after the returned writer.</doc>
