<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/tooling_util.h' l='271'>// The process of building models varies according to the import format.
//
// (a) In some cases, such as model-proto format, the model should be fully
// specified. In these cases, no extra action should be taken by this function.
// (b) In other cases, such as TF graphdef format, the desired types of RNN
// arrays are not specified directly in the model, neither can they be inferred.
// However, we can set the types of RNN destination arrays to float. This breaks
// any cycles such as when resolution of the type of an RNN source array depends
// on the type of its destination array.
//
// This function is applied after the main import, after resolution of flags and
// after application of ArraysExtraInfo. It only defaults destination RNN arrays
// to float. If the model is subsequently quantized, it is assumed that the
// model contains sufficient information for that to be completed. If it is
// already quantized, then case (a) should hold.</doc>
