   *
   * Given tensor, this operation returns a tensor that has the same values as
   * tensor, but with a newly specified shape.
   *
   * Supported tensor types:
   * * {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32}
   * * {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_QUANT8_ASYMM}
   *
   * Supported tensor rank: up to 4.
   *
   * Inputs:
   * * 0: A tensor, specifying the tensor to be reshaped.
   * * 1: A 1-D tensor of type {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_INT32}, defining
   * the shape of the output tensor. The number of elements implied by shape
   * must be the same as the number of elements in the input tensor.
   *
   * Outputs:
   * * 0: The output tensor, of shape specified by the input shape.
