<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/hlo_alias_analysis.cc' l='41'>// Data structure used to construct the alias analysis. Thrown away after alias
// analysis is complete. This data structure keeps track of which sets of
// HloValues must be in the same HloBuffer. This is maintained as a map from a
// buffer identifier (BufferNumber) to set of HLoValues.
//
// Initially each value is its own buffer. In MergeAliasedBuffers, sets of
// values which must share the same buffer are merged together. The end result
// is a partitioning of all HloValues into sets where each set needs its own
// HloBuffer. By performing this analysis without constructing HloBuffers on the
// fly, we can after-the-fact construct a vector of contiguously numbered
// HloBuffers after the buffer requirement has been determined.</doc>
