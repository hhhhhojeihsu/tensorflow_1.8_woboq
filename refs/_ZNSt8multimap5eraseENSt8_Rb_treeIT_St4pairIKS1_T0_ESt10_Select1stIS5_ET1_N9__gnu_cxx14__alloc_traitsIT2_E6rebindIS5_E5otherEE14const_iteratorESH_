       *  This function erases a sequence of elements from a %multimap.
       *  Note that this function only erases the elements, and that if
       *  the elements themselves are pointers, the pointed-to memory is not
       *  touched in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s
       *  responsibility.
