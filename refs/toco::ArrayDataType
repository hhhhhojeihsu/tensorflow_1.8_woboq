<doc f='tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco/model.h' l='153'>// The type of the scalars in an array.
// Note that that does not by itself tell whether the values in the array are
// real (are literally interpreted as real numbers) or quantized (only acquire
// a meaning as real numbers in conjunction with QuantizationParams).
//
// In practice though:
//   float values are always real
//   uint8 values are always quantized
//   int32 values are either real or quantized (depending on whether
//   QuantizationParams are present).
//   other types are unused at the moment.
//
// kNone means that we don&apos;t know the data type yet, or that we don&apos;t care
// because we&apos;ll be dropping the array anyway (e.g. some exotic array types
// may be involved only in debug-only subgraphs that we may not be interested
// in actually supporting).</doc>
